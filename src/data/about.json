  "description": "Meme-driven coding community that blends humor with hands-on learning—perfect for devs who love to laugh and level up.",
  "content": [
    "We're not just a meme page—we’re a movement. A fun, casual hub for developers, programmers, and anyone curious about code—whether you're just starting out or already pushing to prod.",
    "Our core vibe? Mixing memes with meaningful learning. From HTML and CSS to JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and beyond—we roast, we teach, we repeat. Sometimes we dive deep into a single stack. Sometimes it’s all chaos. Either way, you’ll leave smarter (and smiling).",
    "IMPHNEN takes inspiration from global dev communities, but keeps things unapologetically chill. We collaborate with creators, educators, and developer groups like Web Programming UNPAS, Programmer Zaman Now, GDG, and more—especially if their meme game is strong.",
    "Our mission: Blend comedy and code. Make dev life less intimidating. Learn new tech. Fall in love with programming—one meme at a time."
